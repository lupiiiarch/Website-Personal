      <h2>Informal and Formal Variations</h2>
      <p>Some expressions have formal alternatives. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How are you?</strong> (formal) vs. <em>What's up?</em> (informal)</li>
        <li><strong>Good luck</strong> (formal) vs. <em>Break a leg</em> (informal)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's important to choose expressions depending on the situation and the people you are speaking with.</p>
