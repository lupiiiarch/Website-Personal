        <h2>What Are Relative Pronouns?</h2>
        <p>Relative pronouns are words used to connect a clause or phrase to a noun or pronoun. They introduce relative clauses, which give more information about the noun.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>List of Common Relative Pronouns</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who:</strong> Refers to people as the subject of the relative clause.</li>
            <li><strong>Whom:</strong> Refers to people as the object of the relative clause.</li>
            <li><strong>Which:</strong> Refers to animals or things.</li>
            <li><strong>That:</strong> Can refer to people, animals, or things in restrictive clauses.</li>
            <li><strong>Whose:</strong> Shows possession; can refer to people, animals, or things.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>How to Use Relative Pronouns in Sentences</h2>
        <p>Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses that modify a noun or pronoun. There are two types of relative clauses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Restrictive clauses:</strong> Essential to the meaning of the sentence. Usually no commas are used.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-restrictive clauses:</strong> Provide extra information, usually separated by commas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restrictive: The book <em>that</em> you gave me is interesting.</li>
            <li>Non-restrictive: My car, <em>which</em> is red, is parked outside.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Examples of Relative Clauses and Their Functions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who:</strong> The woman <em>who lives next door</em> is a doctor. (Refers to a person, subject)</li>
            <li><strong>Whom:</strong> The man <em>whom you met yesterday</em> is my uncle. (Refers to a person, object)</li>
            <li><strong>Which:</strong> The movie <em>which won the award</em> was excellent. (Refers to things or animals)</li>
            <li><strong>That:</strong> The house <em>that Jack built</em> is old. (Restrictive clause for people/things)</li>
            <li><strong>Whose:</strong> The student <em>whose phone rang</em> apologized. (Shows possession)</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Difference Between 'That' and 'Which'</h2>
        <p><strong>That</strong> is used in restrictive clauses (essential information) without commas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The book <em>that</em> has a blue cover is mine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Which</strong> is used in non-restrictive clauses (extra information) with commas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The book, <em>which</em> has a blue cover, is mine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: In American English, this distinction is very important. In British English, sometimes <em>which</em> is used in restrictive clauses as well.</p>
