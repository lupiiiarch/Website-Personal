      <h2>What is Reported Speech?</h2>
      <p>Reported speech (also called indirect speech) is used to report what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It is the opposite of direct speech.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct speech:</strong> He said, "I am tired."</li>
        <li><strong>Reported speech:</strong> He said that he was tired.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tense Changes in Reported Speech</h2>
      <p>When we report what someone said, we usually shift the tense back (backshifting), especially when the reporting verb is in the past tense.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Direct Speech</th>
            <th>Reported Speech</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Present Simple: "I work hard."</td>
            <td>He said that he <strong>worked</strong> hard.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Present Continuous: "I am cooking."</td>
            <td>She said she <strong>was cooking</strong>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Past Simple: "I visited Paris."</td>
            <td>He said he <strong>had visited</strong> Paris.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Will: "I will help you."</td>
            <td>She said she <strong>would help</strong> me.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pronoun Changes</h2>
      <p>Pronouns also need to change to match the speaker and context:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct: She said, "I love my job."</li>
        <li>Reported: She said that <strong>she</strong> loved <strong>her</strong> job.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common Reporting Verbs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Say</strong>: She said (that) she was happy.</li>
        <li><strong>Tell</strong> (needs an object): She told me (that) she was happy.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask</strong>: He asked me where I lived.</li>
        <li><strong>Suggest</strong>, <strong>advise</strong>, <strong>warn</strong>: often followed by a verb in base or -ing form.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Examples of Direct and Reported Speech</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct: John said, "I’m learning English."</li>
        <li>Reported: John said that he was learning English.</li>
        <li>Direct: Mary asked, "Do you like pizza?"</li>
        <li>Reported: Mary asked if I liked pizza.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Using Reported Speech</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the reporting verb tense to decide if you need to backshift the verb tense.</li>
        <li>Change pronouns and time expressions appropriately: <em>"today"</em> becomes <em>"that day"</em>, <em>"tomorrow"</em> becomes <em>"the next day"</em>.</li>
        <li>Use "that" to introduce statements, and "if/whether" to introduce yes/no questions.</li>
        <li>Don’t change the tense if the reporting verb is in the present or if the situation is still true.</li>
      </ul>
