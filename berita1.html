        <h2>Definition of Conditional Sentences</h2>
        <p>Conditional sentences are sentences that express a condition and the result that will occur if the condition is fulfilled. These sentences usually consist of two main parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If-clause (condition):</strong> The part that states the requirement or condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Main clause (result):</strong> The part that expresses the result or consequence of the condition.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Four Main Types of Conditional Sentences</h2>
        <p>Conditional sentences are divided into four main types based on time and the likelihood of the condition happening:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Zero Conditional</strong>: General facts and scientific truths.</li>
            <li><strong>First Conditional</strong>: Real possibilities in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Second Conditional</strong>: Hypothetical situations in the present or future.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Conditional</strong>: Hypothetical situations in the past (unreal).</li>
        </ol>
